# Personal Project Catalog

**Purpose**: Your private registry for **personal** projects and tags.  
**Scope**: Only projects you create under `personal/` (inbox, learning, and "create project" projects).  
**Team projects** live in `Projects/` and are listed in the team catalog (`Projects/catalog-team.md` in this repo) — they are not listed here.

## Personal portfolio

| Project          | Tag               | Description                      | Status | Location      |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------- | ------ | ------------- |
| **Things To Do** | `#things-to-do`   | Loose tasks & ideas (inbox)      | Active | `ThingsToDo/` |
| **Things To Learn** | `#things-to-learn` | Learning topics and resources | Active | `ThingsToLearn/` |

Add rows below when you run "create project [Name]". Do not add team projects from `Projects/` here.

## Tagging (personal)

- **Project tags**: `#project-name` (lowercase-with-hyphens). Register new projects in the table above.
- **Reserved**: `#things-to-do`, `#things-to-learn` are defaults.

For team projects and shared workflows, see `Projects/` and the team catalog.
